    <h2>AI Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name is Laasya Machineni, and I’m a Computer Science major with a concentration in Information Technology and a minor in Bioinformatics at UNC Charlotte. I’m passionate about learning how technology can solve real-world problems, especially in areas like biology, data science, and human-centered design. Beyond academics, I love exploring creative fields such as photography, digital design, and dance because they allow me to express ideas in unique and meaningful ways. My professional and academic experiences, from tutoring to working in retail to engaging in CS clubs, have strengthened my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. As I continue my journey in computing, I hope to design innovative solutions that blend creativity with technical skill, while constantly growing as a learner, collaborator, and future developer.</p>
